CODE TRACING in the classroom
======================================


PROS:
---------------------------------------
<general positive aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>

*very relateable to the AP exam and IB exam with psuedocode and algorithm tracing and trace tables
* Could work for block based - still trying to figure out how 
* Great way to visualize looping and recursion in a function

CONS:
---------------------------------------
<general negative aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>

* Could still be a bit too abstract for younger kids so would have 
to be physicalized somehow - legos could be useful or pennies 

BEST FOR:
---------------------------------------
<types of activities from courses you teach or have taught that could benefit from an emphasis on tracing>

* debugging
* understanding looping
* breaking down an algorithm into digestable chunks 
  *constructors
* differentiation for complex topics--provide skeleton of trace diagram and have them fill out as we go.--lets groups share with one another and/or work in group


LEAST-SUITED TO:
---------------------------------------
<opposite of above -- and why>

* First introduction of a topic -- let code run and then debug or use to explain more in depth the "under the hood"
* Careful of too many variables, methods, or 'things' going on


PROVEN PRO-TIPS:
---------------------------------------
<
 anything that has worked well for any member of your team, in the way of ...
 * live tracing ("trace-along" a la livecoding)
    - seeing different ways of doing it
 * tracing as an assignment
    - choosing which style work best
 * tools, physical/online/otherwise that make it easier/clearer
    - Python tutor
    - manipulatives (we came up with the idea of legos)
 * etc

RESOURCES:
---------------------------------------
< any links, reading titles, names, etc. you have find useful >
* pythontutor
* print traces -- tracing in the code through print statements
